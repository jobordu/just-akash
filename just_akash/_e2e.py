"""Shared helpers for e2e test scripts.

Centralizes:
  - tier resolution from env (preferred ∪ backup) for provider verification
  - leak-proof cleanup: SIGINT/SIGTERM handler + retry-on-fail destroy + post-destroy audit

These helpers are imported by just_akash/test_lifecycle.py, test_secrets_e2e.py,
and test_shell_e2e.py. Keeping them here ensures all three e2e tests share the
same "no deployment leak" behavior — if any one diverges, that's a bug to fix
here, not by patching three call sites.
